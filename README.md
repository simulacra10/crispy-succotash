# crispy-succotash
Originally called "Domain Names for Sale JSON Template", Git suggested crispy-succotash and I loved the suggestion and took it. Crispy Succotash is a simple HTML5 template that uses Bootstrap, JQuery, and JSON to dynamically display a table.

I am releasing this in the Public Domain. It's yours now. Please do with it as you wish, with or without credit.
